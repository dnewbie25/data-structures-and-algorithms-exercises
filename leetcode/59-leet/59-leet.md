# 59th -- Confirmation Rate




by *[dnewbie25](https://leetcode.com/u/dnewbie25/)*


## Task
The confirmation rate of a user is the number of 'confirmed' messages divided by the total number of requested confirmation messages. The confirmation rate of a user that did not request any confirmation messages is 0. Round the confirmation rate to two decimal places.

Write a solution to find the confirmation rate of each user.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

```sql
Table: Signups

+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
user_id is the column of unique values for this table.
Each row contains information about the signup time for the user with ID user_id.
 

Table: Confirmations

+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
| action         | ENUM     |
+----------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key (combination of columns with unique values) for this table.
user_id is a foreign key (reference column) to the Signups table.
action is an ENUM (category) of the type ('confirmed', 'timeout')
Each row of this table indicates that the user with ID user_id requested a confirmation message at time_stamp and that confirmation message was either confirmed ('confirmed') or expired without confirming ('timeout').


Example 1:

Input: 
Signups table:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | time_stamp          |
+---------+---------------------+
| 3       | 2020-03-21 10:16:13 |
| 7       | 2020-01-04 13:57:59 |
| 2       | 2020-07-29 23:09:44 |
| 6       | 2020-12-09 10:39:37 |
+---------+---------------------+
Confirmations table:
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
| user_id | time_stamp          | action    |
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
| 3       | 2021-01-06 03:30:46 | timeout   |
| 3       | 2021-07-14 14:00:00 | timeout   |
| 7       | 2021-06-12 11:57:29 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-13 12:58:28 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-14 13:59:27 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-02-28 23:59:59 | timeout   |
+---------+---------------------+-----------+
Output: 
+---------+-------------------+
| user_id | confirmation_rate |
+---------+-------------------+
| 6       | 0.00              |
| 3       | 0.00              |
| 7       | 1.00              |
| 2       | 0.50              |
+---------+-------------------+
Explanation: 
User 6 did not request any confirmation messages. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 3 made 2 requests and both timed out. The confirmation rate is 0.
User 7 made 3 requests and all were confirmed. The confirmation rate is 1.
User 2 made 2 requests where one was confirmed and the other timed out. The confirmation rate is 1 / 2 = 0.5.
```


## Test Examples

```js
Case 1
Signups =
| user_id | time_stamp          |
| ------- | ------------------- |
| 3       | 2020-03-21 10:16:13 |
| 7       | 2020-01-04 13:57:59 |
| 2       | 2020-07-29 23:09:44 |
| 6       | 2020-12-09 10:39:37 |
Confirmations =
| user_id | time_stamp          | action    |
| ------- | ------------------- | --------- |
| 3       | 2021-01-06 03:30:46 | timeout   |
| 3       | 2021-07-14 14:00:00 | timeout   |
| 7       | 2021-06-12 11:57:29 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-13 12:58:28 | confirmed |
| 7       | 2021-06-14 13:59:27 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-01-22 00:00:00 | confirmed |
| 2       | 2021-02-28 23:59:59 | timeout   |

```


## Notes

I made this exercise to practice SQL as I found that I have been forgetting how to work with it.

## My solution with comments:

```sql
-- This CTE (Common Table Expression) calculates the total number of confirmation requests and the number of confirmed requests for each user
WITH ConfirmationStats AS (
    SELECT
        user_id,
        COUNT(*) AS total_requests,  -- Counts the total number of confirmation requests made by each user
        SUM(CASE WHEN action = 'confirmed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS confirmed_requests  -- Sums up the number of requests that were successfully confirmed for each user
    FROM Confirmations
    GROUP BY user_id
)

-- Selects each user from the Signups table and calculates their confirmation rate
SELECT
    s.user_id,
    COALESCE(ROUND(confirmed_requests * 1.0 / total_requests, 2), 0) AS confirmation_rate  -- Calculates the confirmation rate, rounding to 2 decimal places, or returns 0 if no requests were made
FROM Signups s
LEFT JOIN ConfirmationStats cs  -- Ensures users with no confirmation requests are still included, with a rate of 0
ON s.user_id = cs.user_id;


```

## Interesting LeetCode solution:

```sql
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select s.user_id, round(avg(if(c.action="confirmed",1,0)),2) as confirmation_rate
from Signups as s left join Confirmations as c on s.user_id= c.user_id group by user_id;
```

## Notes about the interesting one:

I got mesmerized with the 2-lines solution this person has. I was working in my querie for about 1 hour.
