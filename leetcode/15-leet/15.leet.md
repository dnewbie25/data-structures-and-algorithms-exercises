# 15th -- Palindrome Number





by *[dnewbie25](https://leetcode.com/u/dnewbie25/)*


## Task

Given an integer x, return true if x is a palindrome, and false otherwise.

 
```py
Example 1:

Input: x = 121
Output: true
Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
```

## Test Examples

```py
Case 1
Input
x = 121

Case 2
Input
x = -121

Case 3
Input
x = 10
```


## Notes

This challenge was to practice Python syntax, as I have been forgetting it lately.

## My solution with comments:

```py
class Solution:
    ''' this code takes the number x, converts it to string and then as an array. Reverses the order and then
     joins it to compare the result with the initial string x '''
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        string = str(x)
        print(string)
        arr = list(string)
        arr.reverse()
        return ''.join(arr)==string

```

```py
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0:
            return False

        reversed_num = 0
        temp = x

        while temp != 0:
            digit = temp % 10
            reversed_num = reversed_num * 10 + digit
            temp //= 10

        return reversed_num == x

```

## Notes about the interesting one:

This solution is really good because it does not use built-in functions
